# Dashboard
The applications dashboard is not displaying the right number of applications.
We need to add a funnel view showing how many jobs applied, out of those how many interview, how many accepted offer, ...
Additionally, several more charts should be added that will be helpful to see the stats of the performance.

# Applications
In the table I should be able to change the status of the application choosing between Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected.


# Chat
The chat should only have chats initiated from the chat page itself, not the other chats. Please find a way to integrate this mechanism. Therefore, if I am generating a resume for a job, or extracting a job from a paste text, that won't show up as a chat. Only chats initiated from the chat page will show up there.
