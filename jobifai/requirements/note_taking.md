# Note Taking
This page will be a note taking page, where I will be able to take notes about my daily career. It will be like a professional agenda. But the goal is not to plan, but just to express my daily feelings about the career day, or just to memorize something. This would also be used by someone who doesn't have a resume or first user of the app, and just want to say who they are, what they did, and what they want to do.
It will be a way to get to know the user, and understand their professional goals. It needs to have a nice UI, and functionalities Obsidian-like. The user should be able to access previous notes.
